## Welcome to my ENG 388A Profile Page


Your Name: Spencer Spooner



Why are you adventuring?<br />
I’ve been surviving on canned cat food for a long amount of time and my supplies have run low. This is a matter of survival and self-preservation so I have ventured out to survive. I am a 65-year-old man who has lived off of his own inherent selfishness and  am eagerly awaiting the day I can call it quits.

Motivation:<br />

What motivates you? Do you want to help people? Do you want to serve a cause? Own resources? Have power?<br />
My own selfish sense of self-preservation at the expense of others will be my main motivation in surviving. I will only help others if it personally benefits me and I do not believe in charity.  I don’t want to own  anything beyond the required resources required for me to sustain my life. The primary motivation for myself is to survive and to live a life of relative comfort until I die. I will only associate with those who are useful to my goals. Morals do not stand in my way when it comes to my self-preservation. 
ㅡ
Skills:<br />

What are the key skills  that your character has had that might be useful in the game world? Are you a leader? Do you have research skills? Are you charismatic?<br />

I have endured living a life of scavenging like a rat among the hollowed husks of our old civilization. I can survive nearly anything due to my desperation and lack of regret when it comes to my actions. I am well-versed in surviving out in the wilderness and foraging for my own food. I can cooperate with a group but only if it benefits me and if the direction heads toward a situation that does not benefit us (mainly myself) then I will abandon that group immediately because I don’t want to take chances with people that think with their hearts over their brains.
ㅡ
Personality:<br />

List 3 positive personality traits, 2 character flaws, and 1 thing you strongly believe.<br />

Positive: Adaptable, Willful, Decisive
Negative: Manipulative, Cowardly
I strongly believe  that every person should be out for themselves. It’s perfectly fine to work collaboratively with a group but if the situation ends up negatively impacting our group then there is no point in sticking together. I believe in the willpower of the individual over the need to accommodate those who are dependent on others to survive. I am manipulative and good at weaseling my way out of personal accountability. 


ㅡ
Experiences:<br />

List 2 major successes and 2 major failures that your character has experienced.<br />

Successes: I am an expert in brewing my own alcohol and  it has culminated into having my own hidden recipe in which I put scorpion venom into a prison-style wine for that extra kick.
I invented one of the greatest tools of mankind. I named it the spoon (don’t fact check me please) however, the trademark and copyright laws are still pending.  

Failures: I have the misfortune of being both a gambling addict and being terrible with gambling. I once lost my pet raccoon, my clothes, and all of my cash on hand to a  nomadic group of circus clowns. 

I have no comprehension or understanding of sarcasm even though I am a native English speaker. I will take words at literal face value.
